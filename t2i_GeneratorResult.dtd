DTD for a results of a single generator run 

  GeneratorResults - Contains the generation results of a single system.
                    This may include either a single run or multiple runs against all the topics. 

     teamName - The team name identifier

  GeneratorRunResult - Contains the generation results of a single run with given configuration.

     trainingData - what kind of training data was applied to the model (system)
     priority     - evaluation priority (1,2,...) If not all runs can be judged, then judging will begin with the run with priorty 1 and so on.
     trained      - A boolean (T or F) to indicate if the run was the output of a trained system by the team specifically for this task (T) or the output of an already existing system that the team used to generate the outputs (F)
     desc         - Name of the base model
     link         - A link to the model used to generate the run (e.g. GitHub, etc)


  GeneratorTopicResult
     topic - topic ID
     elapsedTime  - would be the time in seconds from the time the system is presented with the
                   topic until generating the image
     usedImagePrompts - A boolean to indicate if a topic has used sample image as part of the prompt

  Image
     filename     - filename
     prompt       - the textual component of the prompt used for generating an image
     NIST-prompt  - A boolean to indicate if the generated image was based on the provided based on the official prompt (T), or based on a modified prompt by the team (F).
